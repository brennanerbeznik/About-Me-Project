I am a writer. I am a futursist. I am a historian. I am a programmer. I am a scientist. I am a filmmaker. I am proud to be an American. I love fast. Everything. 

The most important things in my life are my family & friends, a passion for knowledge, developing my self and my business to be as fresh and unique as possible, exploration of new areas (real and virtual), and of course -- creating. 

I am from Venice, California. 

My favorite hobbies are reading, hiking (exploring), writing stories, filmmaking, and pushing myself in any capacity. 

My dream job is to be founder of a company that changes the way humans learn. I want to create a technology that enables humans to learn at 1000x the efficiency they currently operate at. Whether this couples with an AI like machine, or wearable -- or something entirely new. Who knows? Let's find out. 

I have been listening to Taylor Swift, Eminem and the Postive Electronica playlist on Spotify. Trendy? Who's ready for Coachella? 

Kidding.
